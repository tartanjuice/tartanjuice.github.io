<p>The original lots available in Alexandria in the late 1700s were quarter blocks. Over time those divided into smaller plots. You can find homes where they divided the lot and the next available street address was already taken. So they were left with half and three-quarters of an address.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a &ldquo;<a href="https://notunremarkable.me/project-365/">Project 365</a>&rdquo; for several years now. In 2023 I switched it up and did a &ldquo;Project 52&rdquo;. I ended up puttering out towards the end of the year because life got busy. I&rsquo;m back to try another year of photos every day.</p>
<p>Last year, the wife and I moved to <a href="https://visitalexandria.com/old-town/">Old Town Alexandria</a>. So, I&rsquo;m going to try to focus on this awesome little city this year. Hope you enjoy!</p>
